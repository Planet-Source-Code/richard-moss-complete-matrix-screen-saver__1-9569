### Description

A complete screen saver based on the film "The Matrix"

This code is based on the original submission by Stuart Pennington, however adds more functionality. It is now a complete screen saver, with customisation options, and real previews in the config dialog and Display Properties. It also has a couple of minor bug fixes.

The code also has some API routines for selecting colours and fonts.

Well worth a look if you liked the original submission.
